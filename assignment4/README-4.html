<h3>Java ExecutorCompletionService Framework and Readers/Writer Synchronizers (Assignment 4)</h3>

<P>The objectives of this assignment are to learn how to synchronize
gazes by concurrent Beings via a readers-writer lock (implemented
using a Java <A
HREF="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/StampedLock.html">StampedLock</A>)
and a fair semaphore (implemented using your solution to <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS5254/tree/master/assignments/assignment3b/">assignment
3b</a>).  Videos describing Java StampedLock appear <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QER63oNLpAE&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3&index=51">here</a>
and <A
HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2ywEZ9sZSU&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4p5piHxajQXRRlsyDCLvI3&index=52">here</a>.
I recommend you watch these videos to ensure you understand how to
apply the Java StampedLock synchronizer.  Naturally, this topic is
covered in class, as well. </P>

<P>The fair semaphore and a Java StampedLock are used to enhance the
Java <A
HREF="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorCompletionService.html">ExecutorCompletionService</A>
framework implementation of the PalantiriSimulator app from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS5254/tree/master/assignments/assignment3a/">Assignment
3A</A>. Assignment 4 applies these enhancements to the
PalantiriManager, which restricts the number of Beings from
Middle-Earth who can concurrently gaze into a fixed number of
Palantiri. </P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Assignment Structure and Functionality</H4>

<P>The PalantiriSimulator app is packaged as a project using the
latest version of Android Studio.  This app is written in both Kotlin
and Java and demonstrates <EM>many</EM> Android capabilities.

For the purposes of Assignment 4, however, you only need to be aware
of the following three directories:

<UL>

<LI> <A HREF="
app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/Palantiri/stampedLockFairSemaphore/">app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/Palantiri/stampedLockFairSemaphore</A>,
which contains the skeleton(s) you'll need to fill in, as
described <A HREF="#description">below</A>. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A>, which is a set of unit
tests that exercise many PalantiriSimulator features and can be used
to help test the functionality you implement for the assignment. <P>

<LI> <A HREF="app/src/androidTest">app/src/androidTest</A>, which is
an Android Studio instrumentation test that runs your app
automatically.  <P>

</UL>

<P>You'll also need to integrate your enhanced solution for the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/Beings/completionService">completionService</A>
folder from <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS5254/tree/master/assignments/assignment3a/">Assignment
3A</a> into the latest/greatest <CODE>completionService</CODE>
skeleton and use it as implementation of the BeingManager for
Assignment 4 (make sure to address all my comments from Assignment 3A
and 3B into your Assignment 4 solution). </P>

<P>To compile this code you need to use the provided Android Studio
project.  You can run this project by clicking the green "Run 'app'"
button in the Android Studio IDE, which should automatically select an
Android Emulator to run, assuming you have one created.  The app is
designed to work with Android API level 33, so you'll need to select
an emulator that uses API level 33.  If you don't already have an
emulator created you can create it by clicking on the "AVD Manager"
button in the Android Studio IDE.</>

<A name="description">
<H4>Program Description and "TODO" Tasks</H4>

<P>You'll need to modify several files containing the skeleton Java
code by completing the "TODO - You fill in here" tasks to provide a
working solution.  DO NOT CHANGE THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE SKELETON
- just fill in the "TODO" tasks!!!  In particular, you'll need to
finish implementing the following "TODO" tasks for this assignment in
the <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/Palantiri/stampedLockFairSemaphore">stampedLockFairSemaphore</A> folder: </P>

<UL>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/Palantiri/stampedLockFairSemaphore/stampedLockFairSemaphoreMgr.java">stampedLockFairSemaphoreMgr.java</A>. You'll
need to complete the "TODO" tasks in various methods to implement a
PalantiriManager via a fair semaphore, a StampedLock, and a HashMap.
</P>

<LI> <P><A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/Palantiri/stampedLockFairSemaphore/FairSemaphoreMO.java">FairSemaphoreMO.java</A>
or <A
HREF="app/src/main/java/edu/vandy/simulator/managers/Palantiri/stampedLockFairSemaphore/FairSemaphoreCO.java">FairSemaphoreCO.java</A>. You'll
need integrate your assignment 3B solution into the "TODO" tasks in
various methods to implement a counting semaphore using either a
built-in Java monitor object (if you're an undergraduate) or a Java
Condition Object and ReentrantLock (if you're a graduate
student). </P> </UL>

<P>Your app will be considered correct if it (1) passes all the unit
and instrumentation tests and (2) all Beings successfully complete all
their N iterations.  A correct simulation should restrict the number
of gazing Beings to the number of Palantiri.  In other words, if there
are four Palantiri in the simulation, then only four Beings should
ever be ``gazing'' on the screen at a time.</P>

<P>When the simulation is running, the app view will display visual
feedback to show Palantiri and Being states, as well as the progress
of their gazing iterations.  If your assignment implementation is
correct---and does not throw any exceptions---then the app title bar
labels will appear <EM>green</EM> when the simulation completes. If
your solution is not implemented correctly---or throws an
exception---then <EM>red</EM> title bar labels will be displayed when
the simulation completes.</P>

<H4>Additional "TO DO" Tasks for Graduate Students</H4>

<P>Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for graduate
credit) must perform the following additional task:</P>

<UL>

<LI> Enhance the <CODE>StampedLockSimpleSemaphoreMgr.java</CODE> file
to use Java functional programming features (such as method
references, lambda expressions, and/or sequential streams) in several
places.

</UL>

<P>Undergraduates are welcome to implement these Java functional
programming enhancements, but it's not required.</P>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Skeleton Code</H4>

<P>Skeleton code for this assignment is available from my <A
HREF="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS5254/tree/master/assignments/assignment4/">GitHub</a>
account.  Now that you've setup your <A
HREF="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull this
skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
"TODO" markers. The additional work required by graduate students is
clearly marked.</P>

<hr width=50% align=left> <h4>Unit Tests</h4>

<p> Unit tests in the <A HREF="app/src/test">app/src/test</A> folder
are provided to increase our confidence that your implementation is
working as expected.  It's essential that you use the Android Studio
GUI to run these unit tests locally on your computer, as described <A
HREF="https://developer.android.com/training/testing/unit-testing/local-unit-tests.html#run">here</a>
and shown later in this video. </P>

As usual, testing only demonstrates the presence of bugs, not their
absence, so don't rely solely on the tests to detect problems in your
code. In particular, I will also provide videos that walk through
"frequently made mistakes" that you should address.  Please address
these issues prior to your submission(s) to streamline our <A
HREF="http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/cs254/assignments.html">programming
assignment review and assessment</A> process.  </p>

<HR width=50% align=left>
<H4>Concluding Remarks</H4>

<P>This assignment is designed to deepen your understanding of
synchronizing multi-threaded programs using the Java StampedLock
synchronizer, which provides a powerful--albeit more complex and
sometimes more efficient--readers-writer synchronizer compared with
the spin-lock and ReentrantLock solutions covered in previous
assignments. </P>
